    <h1>NES [V1.2]:</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, for version 1.2 I have fixed some errors and now you can write the commands in different ways such as; Hello, hello or HELLO.
        I have also incorporated at the last minute a command that I see future since it is a section for games in which I will try to bring a new game with each update. At the moment the only game available is 'Rock, paper and scissors'.
        The new commands in this version are; ‘Activate calculator mode’ (With which you can obviously make calculations), ‘Random’ (Which will offer you a random number) and finally ‘Play’ (As I have already mentioned it is a set of games).
        If you want to be more informed about when I will release the next versions of N.E.S, I recommend that you visit <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Garlok_Dev"> my Twitter</a> from time to time. 
        And with all this explained, I can only say that you enjoy NES totally free and safe, and you are invited to communicate any error or recommendation from <a target = "_ blank" href = "https://www.twitter.com/Garlok_Dev" > my Twitter </a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Garlok-Dev/NES/"> the official Github page for this project. </a>
        To open this project you need to have Python downloaded. This can be done from the <a target="_blank"_blank" href="https://www.python.org"> official Python page. </a>
        <br>
        This project is a old version of <a href="https://garlok-dev.github.io/slave/index.html">'Slave'</a>, I recoomend you to use the 'new' version. ( I was very bad in python in this moment :'{ )
